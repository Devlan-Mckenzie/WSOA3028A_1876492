			<h2>Some History on Stephen Burns</h2>
				<p>Hi my name is Stephen Burns and I am currently 25 years old. I was born and raised in South African and my current occupation is a Software Developer. I got my degree from the University of Witwatersrand and got employed right after I graduated.</p>
				<p>I am 1.79 m tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes, I would say that my build is on the slimmer side but other than that I am usually in perfect health and live a healthy life style. I am your average guy and like to wear a black shirt and jeans as my preferred clothing of the day.</p>
				<p>I was often told that I could be a doctor like my dad was due to my terrible hand writing but I always wanted to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, and either wanted to make games or interact with code in general. My father died when I was young and my mother had to raise me all on her own. My mom is an awesome individual that never complained about our situation once and thankfully her job as a writer allowed her to raise me with minimal issues.  As both my parents were successful I was raised in an upper class family and received a higher education because my mom always made me do my work before I could play games at home on my computer.</p>
				<p>In school I was one of the founders of a computer gaming club and that served as my one and only club activity. I wasn’t very expressive in school and people were a bit put off by that but to those that knew me I was a fun and relaxed guy.</p>
				<p>Moving on I don’t want to poor my heart out here that’s not what I am making this site for. This site is more for learning coding practices and developing a sense of how to make a good website. I will be learning alongside many of you as this is my first attempt at web design and will likely change the site a lot.  Welcome to my site again and I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I am.</p>
