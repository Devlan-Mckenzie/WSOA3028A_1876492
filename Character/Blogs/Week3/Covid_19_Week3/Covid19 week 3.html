			<h2>The Third Week of Lockdown</h2>
				<p>	Hey guys so it’s week 3 and all the days have started to merge together and the lockdown would have end by now if they didn’t extend it. I am not looking forward to the next 2 weeks as it looks like it just getting worse, from what I have heard from close friends and co-workers they have started to distribute food and water among the municipalities which have started to share them among the people, however there are disturbing reports that the municipal officials have begun to steal them as they themselves have started to fear for their livelihoods.</p>
				<p>I went outside today I had to buy more food just the basic necessities like bread and milk.  This week has been tough and many people outside are wearing masks and gloves. People are still trying to use as much hand sanitizer as possible. They say that those that profited off the hand sanitiser buying spree will be fined and that it’s illegal to profit off of a pandemic so that’s alarming.</p>
				<p>Works been flowing smoothly and many companies are using Git Hub and Zoom to keep working efficiently. I wrote a short blog post on how you too can use Git Hub to stay up to date, and I would recommend it as a free alternative for any of you that have no alternative or are coding in some way. It is simple and offers an excellent method of integrating.</p>
				<p>That is all for this blog post. Stay safe out there. </p>
