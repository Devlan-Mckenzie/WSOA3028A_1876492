		<h2>The WireFrames<h2>
			<p> This blog post will discuss the wireframes of the site and how they came to be. The use photocopied images will serve to aid in the discussion around them and give you a general idea as to what I will be referring to.</p>
			<p> The image below was my first wireframe for the sight and while it may look like it has more on it that the second wireframe design that’s because it was trying to cram too much into one page and while doable it is bad practice. As such the second wireframe took a more generalised approach and made use of consistent UI so that the user felt familiar at all time when browsing the site and once they learned how to go somewhere would not have to relearn it further down the line. </p>
			<img src="../Images/Original Wireframe.png" alt="An image of the Original Wireframe used in the creation of this site" height="1000" width="800">
			<p> This is the Updated Wireframe and will show you how the site has changed.</p>
			<img src="../Images/Updated Wireframe.png" alt="An image of the Updated Wireframe used in the creation of this site" height="1000" width="800">
			<p>The UI was made with simplicity and use ability in mind and took on a more general approach as well. This allowed for the consistent use of UI elements and made site navigation easy and manageable unlike before where all the blog posts would have been in a single HTML file which would have been chaotic and made for a nightmare site to manage. </p>
			<p>The images themselves have some text on them which basically go through why certain things are  in the positions they are and how they could change in the future, in addition to this some web pages may alter depending on whether or not I learn of a better way or simply want to try something new like JavaScript.</p>
