			<h2>Graham Blog Post<h2>
				<p>This blog post will be one of many discussing the paper “Towards a study of information geographies” by Graham et al, this will be broken up into multiple blog posts as I have been busy in real life. The paper he wrote was about information and its geography. In the abstract we can see that according to Graham information has always had a geography attached to it and this is seen in “Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places.”</p>
				<p>A statement I must agree with as it is simply irrefutable, not only that it is also why geographic augmentations are more than the representation of places, this is why the geographic augmentations form part of the place itself and help create the place rather than show it. This can be supported by “In other words, geographic augmentations are much more than just representations of places: they are part of the place itself; they shape it rather than simply reflect it. This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are immutable means that annotations of place emerge as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations.”</p>
				<p>The paper therefore discusses these geographic distributions and then demonstrates how the access to this information alters they information itself. This is supported by “Through this effort, the paper demonstrates that in addition to the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication, uneven geographies of participation and representation are also evident and in some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated. In other words, the paper comprehensively shows one important facet of contemporary information geographies: that geographic information itself is characterised by a host of uneven geographies. The paper concludes that there are few signs that global informational peripheries are achieving comparable levels of participation or representation with traditional information cores, despite the hopes that the fast-paced spread of the internet to three billion people might change this pattern.”</p>
				<p>Information is adapted to local contexts through the transmission and movement of the information itself. The current era is no different to those that came before as is supported by “In short, information –ranging from standardized measurements to instruction manuals to stories and legends –emerges from, engages with and is adapted to a range of local contexts and geographies. The current era is no different and this article surveys a range of contemporary information geographies to access patterns of mutability, mobility and underlying power relations relative to historical arrangements in the production and use of information.”</p>
				<p>It is because information is adapted through transmission that the attempt to lessen change in information exists and this is done through the creation of Latour which refers to “immutable mobiles” or ” information that can be transported without significant change in its inherent characteristics or meaning”</p>
				<p>This was made easier with the creation of the printing press which could create information on paper and the paper would not change the content through its travels or through the creation of ICT based communication. This communication was adopted by governments and companies for its ability to create “immutable mobiles”, again the information would not change during transmission which was essential for shared understanding of information. This led to the intertwining of information and power as people began to capitalise on the controlling of information.</p>
				<p>An important property of “immutable mobiles” is the fact that they can be moved away from the place of their creation, this meant that they could be locally referenced and referenced in other parts of the world. This meant that when creating this information in an “immutable mobile” form you were both fixing information to a physical object and releasing that information from the geography it was confined too.</p>
				<p>The evolution of ICT allows the same thing to occur but takes it further than that as it introduces layers of mutable and immutable information such as reviews, photos or past experiences thus these places being described become more than mere places they have emotions and views attached to them through this information. This is supported by “The Sydney Opera House, for instance, is not just a building made from bricks and mortar. Nor is it simply represented by guidebook entries, postcards and other immutable mobiles that are trapped within their containers. It is also overlaid with digital images, videos, descriptions, reviews about tours and past performances, as well as innumerable stories told about experiences associated with it that are stored in online maps, annotations and websites. All of those things are informational but are also part of the place itself; they are part of how we enact and bring the place into being 1 (Graham et al. 2013; Graham 2013; Floridi 2011). The advent of the (im) mutable augmentations and mobile tools that allow us to access this information while in situ (for shopping, wayfinding, driving, sightseeing, protesting, and many other geographic activities) places an ever greater value in the epistemic control to fix informational layers of place (Graham et al. 2013).”</p>
				<p>The aforementioned matters as it alters, the way we find and perceive different parts of the world. This statement essentially means that the information above forms part of the place itself, for instances if a restaurant is omitted from a map or has poor things associated with it, it may cease to be a restaurant.</p>
				<p>This leads me to the conclusion of the blog; I will end off by saying that the “geography of information” is and has long been a means of control and power formation. The information augmentation represents a key and emerging area for scholars and in the next blog post we will look at a “brief review of pre-digital geographies of information,” and continue to digest this paper in a series of blog posts.</p>
