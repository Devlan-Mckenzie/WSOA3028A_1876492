			<h2><left>The Stream API </left></h2>
                    <p>In this blog post I would like to explain what this API is and how I used it in this site. This API allows JavaScript to programmatically access streams of data received over a network as desired by the developer. This essentially means that you can receive small chunks of data over a network connection and then process them piece by piece.  This was apparently a recent breakthrough for JavaScript and before this was implemented you guys would have to download the entire file then wait for it to be processed into a useable format and only then process the whole thing once it was fully received.</p>
                    <p>Streams change all that and allow you to start processing raw data with JavaScript bit by bit as soon as it’s available on the client-side.  This will increase performance and accessibility of the site as in Johannesburg not everyone has access to fast internet. This helps to account for that by making the process faster and thus making the site itself more accessible. </p>
                    <p>So I picked this API because I wanted to start working with APIs as they allow you to increase your sites performance and can create cool effects and interactions with users. This API specifically suits my site and was a nice simple API to start learning with.  This API also increases site performance and accessibility which are important around my locale.  This made this API necessary due to its relatively easy implementation and impact it could have with the viewers of the site. The alternative was not to implement streaming, this would make the site performance worse and the accessibility even more so, in Africa internet struggles are a common thing and if I want to design this site for everyone then this wouldn’t really be an option. </p>
                    <p>I chose to use this API because it was a relatively simple API and allowed me to increase the site performance. The technical impact of this was more accessibility and quicker loading times; this in turn made the site more consistent and user friendly. This was implemented on the 2 major link pages of my site the character and theory pages or tabs. These were the most problematic areas in terms of images and downloading the entire file before starting to process it. These were the areas that would be most visibly problematic with a slow internet connection.</p>
                    <p>The Stream API was used to stream the images used in the hyperlinks of the Theory and Character pages of the site as they were the most problematic. This was done and a visible performance increase was seen through my own testing. Hopefully this helps you guys out in some way and even if it only helps a handful of you I got to implement an API which is what I wanted to try from the start.</p>
                    <p>That’s it for this post guys I hope you are all doing well and staying safe out there.</p>
