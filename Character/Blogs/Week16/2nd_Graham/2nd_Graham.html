			<h2><left>Towards a study of information geographies</left></h2>
                    <p>In the last blog post we discussed the introduction to the paper “Towards a study of information geographies” written by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Mathew A. Zook.  To briefly summarize the previous post, the geography of information describes the geographic distribution of information which can occur on its own or due to some driving factor. This distribution of information has been a means of power and control formation for a very long time and is not something new with the internet or modern technologies.  The study of information geographies is becoming a new area of inquiry for scholars and the paper aimed to provide a starting point for these scholars.  The paper also looked at how informational augmentation affects the places they describe. </p>
                    <p>If the above summary was not sufficient then please go take a look at the 1st Graham Blog Post. This post will now describe the “Pre-digital geographies of information” as described in the paper itself.  This section looks to an age before digitalisation and will focus on the systems used for collecting, storing and spreading information. </p>
                    <p>This was a difficult process without technological aid and that meant that information wasn’t readily available as it is today, this meant that information was scarce and confined to the areas it was made in. This meant that the information was “geographically embedded” as stated in the paper.  The paper then goes on to describe an example from the nineteenth century, in essence the examples describe how tools for collecting, storing and spreading information were scares and were concentrated to a handful of places.  This made anything large scale difficult and rare in terms of information collection.</p>
                    <p>This point was strengthened by stating that in order to collect information about a place or thing, one would have to be near it or in it and this required a level of organisation that was quite high which posed a problem. In addition to this the only way of storing information at the time was the book which required specific points of access like libraries. The required skills to manage and manipulate information were also quite rare and any institutions that attempted to do so required resources. These resources had to be stored somewhere and thus become geographically embedded themselves.</p>
                    <p>These institutions thus became places of formalised learning which were “bound and concentrated” in specific locales. This meant that the ability to access information and manipulate it became highly constrained which furthers the previous points mentioned.  While these books were able to be transported, due to their rarity and difficulty to produce they were only available in specific locales and had rules and governances around them. As a result, control over these books, this information, led to political power. </p>
                    <p>The paper expresses the belief that knowledge and codified information are always produced under conditions of power and books, newspapers and patents were more likely to be published by the Global North than the Global South.  The paper also mentions that most of Africa is being left in a technological apartheid, which was of particular interest to me as I live there.  This geographic isolation of information led to systemic and uneven relationships between information and production leading to socio-economic exclusion, those with the information wanted to keep it as a means of staying ahead. These were called the “Black holes of Informational Capitalism” the chapter then ends and the next chapter is the “Changing geographies after the information revolution?” </p>
                    <p>The above was a fair chunk of text so I will try summarizing here and then begin ending off this post. This post describes the collecting, storing and spreading of information as is described in the Graham paper before the digital age. It was shown to be a specialised and new field, which required facilities and resources.  The act of collecting information was difficult as travelling arrangements were difficult to make and those few who could create and manipulate information would require tools which often could not be moved from places of learning like universities. This resulted in the creation of facilities that controlled these processes and as such controlled the information. This in turn lead to political power as this information could be used to improve economic standings and such. This created geographically isolated places of information which furthers the papers point and views.</p>
                    <p>That’s it for this blog post I hope it wasn’t too long or confusing, let me know what you are thinking on Tweeter or send me an email. In the next blog post we will cover another chapter discussing the changing of geographies after the information revolution.</p>
