			<h2><left>Picanha Grill and Brewery</left></h2>
                    <p>This is another post about a restaurant I want to go back too. This time we have moved away from sushi and instead moved to your classic grill and brewery. This restaurant is called Picanha Grill and Brewery Bellairs and is located in Northriding Square located on Bellairs Drive Randburg.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The last time I was here was July last year; I regret not returning before the lockdown. They make a great chicken schnitzel and is the perfect place to go on a Friday night with some friends.  They have a large variety of foods and alcohols to fit everyone’s tastes. I would however recommend you stay away from the giggle juice for a good few drinks.  Either way I have had great experiences there and would recommend it to anyone in the area.</p>
                    <p>The staffs are friendly and they have game nights so if that’s your thing then this restaurant is for you. They have an area to sit at the bar or outside depending on the group’s mood or the evening’s weather.  Smokers are allowed to smoke however they may only do so outside and I think the same may be said for those using Vape devices.</p>
                    <p>They are currently open for delivery and takeaway so if you feel like grill foods one night give them a try. That’s it for this blog post, hoping you’re all safe and sound. Share your experiences on tweeter.</p>
