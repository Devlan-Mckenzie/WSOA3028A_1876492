			<h2><left>Yamakado Sushi</left></h2>
                    <p>Now that we are in a lower lockdown level we have been informed that we may return to restaurants again. This post will be discussing my favourite sushi place which is located in Cedar Square which is in Fourways. The restaurant is called Yamakado and has an excellent review record which is currently sitting at a 4.2 rating.</p>        
                    <p>The place recently upgraded their facilities which were good before but are now super impressive. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The food is great and they have a conveyor belt set up as well as tables which you could sit down and order, however the restaurant is currently only allowing takeaway and delivery. I hope to return to this awesome restaurant soon my last visit was in February and I have missed it very much.</p>

                    <p>My favourite part of the experience is the buffet which allows you to endlessly order starters; my favourite starter is the Crispy Chicken Strips served with mayo and sweet chilli sauce followed up by Avo and Cucumber Yummy rolls. I have had many awesome nights here and cannot wait to return there.</p>
                    <p>Anyway thatâ€™s the end of the post, if any of you guys have been here please share your experiences on twitter. Stay safe out there.</p>
