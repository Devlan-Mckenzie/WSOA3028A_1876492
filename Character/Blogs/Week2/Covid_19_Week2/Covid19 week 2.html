			<h2>The Second Week of Lockdown</h2>
				<p>Hi guys so it’s the end of week 2 now and things are looking bad, the virus is spreading and the death toll across the whole world is rising.  People are being picked up and forced into quarantine and a poor 14 year old girl has tested positive making her the first under 18 in the country, I hope she is okay.</p>
				<p>The government continues to say we will be fine and that everything is within acceptable parameters but I get the feeling that it’s only going to get worse, however let us hope for a swift end to this virus so that we can continue with our lives. The government has started to pay people a small amount of money to survive as our economy continues to decline.</p>
				<p>They say that we have learnt from the other countries that have been infected how to better cope with the virus and that we just need to follow their lead and I believe that this is true to some extent however nobody needs  a cart full of toilet paper and people are starting to panic buy. The reality is scary that just because you went to the shop a loved one might die.</p>
				<p>Many people have swarmed the malls and you cannot find a lot of items that are usually there in abundance like masks and gloves for example. I also believe stores that marked up their prices are going to be fined for trying to profit off the pandemic.</p>
				<p>That’s all for this blog post I hope that you are staying safe and are well in these harsh times.</p>
