			<h2>Character Rationale</h2>
				<p>This blogpost will cover the reason for the creation of Stephen Burns and why he turned out the way he did. The main reason for the creation of the character was because of my web design course in which I learn the theory and practical implementation of a website. In this course I have to cover a portion of creative writing and show that I can apply creativity in this course.</p>
				<p>The background story behind Stephen Burns is tragic because it directly contrasts my personal background story which is pretty normal and when compared to Stephen`s ideal. The reason for the contrast was to challenge myself and allow myself to create something entirely separate in origin. Then I also had to write theory blog posts in this course and I figured it would be weird to have some guy who is a chef be posting theory on the web. It was then that I decided to make Stephen Burns related to the course I am doing and thus me in some way, this would then justify the theory posts and allow me to make a more flowing site that would be more believable to the average person.</p>
				<p>The reason for Stephens’s place of origin is because I currently live there, in South Africa, and this will allow me to post images of the local area and discuss topics relevant to me and thus allow me to further develop his creative elements as I believe I would otherwise struggle.</p>
				<p>The reason for his wife teaching him to cook is because I have an interest in cooking myself  and figured I could learning things along the way and increase the creative levels, plus it would give me an excuse to try create a recipe using the correct tags and seeing how that turned out. In addition to this I would be able to go to restaurants and take photos of the food there and discuss it from a chef’s point of view to increase the blog count of the site.</p>
				<p>Those reasons fell through with the arrival of COVID 19 and the lockdown that followed, the new plan is to write about his life during the lockdown and use that to increase the blog count. </p>
