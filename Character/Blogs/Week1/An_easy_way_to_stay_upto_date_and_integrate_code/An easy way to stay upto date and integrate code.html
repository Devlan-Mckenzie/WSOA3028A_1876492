					<p>One of the first things they teach you in some coding courses at Wits University is the importance of having backups and working well with in a work or group environment. The easiest and most affordable way of doing this is to use Git. The main value in Git is that it is very easy to use and has many tutorials and large amounts of content to help you learn their program and that it is free. It is a great way to keep your code up to date and to keep it safe; Git acts as an online repository that you can commit changes to and create many sub repositories to test code out without having to create entire backups on your machine.</p>
					<p>Git is a practical way of working with in a team or organization as you can all work on the same project at the same time and see any changes done as well as any errors or clashes in code and simply resolve them. The process of doing this is as simple as clicking a button and viewing what appears on screen.  Git has a website which you can login to and view changes any where around the world and Git also has a desktop application which you can install and use as part of your pipeline when creating code. This makes Git easy to use and allows you to make changes and store them on your machine even when you do not have access to the internet , and when you do get access to the internet you can simply commit them to the web.</p>
					<p>In short if you are struggling to keep up to date within a team or even on your own , use Git to store all you changes and history in one place, I would strongly recommend that you install their desktop application and make it part of your pipeline. If you get lost be sure to use their free help and tutorials online and best of all its free so be sure to give it a try.</p>
