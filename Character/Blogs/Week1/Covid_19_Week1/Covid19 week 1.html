			<h2>The First Week of Lockdown</h2>
				<p>So it’s been a week since the announcement of the nationwide lockdown, the government has started a tracking and trace programme where they are trying to find people that may have the virus. The first people that had it came from other countries like Europe and the United States so they are starting there and then tracking down the people they have had contact with.</p>
				<p>This was looking good until they confirmed the first case in the townships of Alexandra and Khayelitsha which are closely packed houses that have poor living conditions and is a perfect place for the virus to spread despite this they say our numbers are still low so I think they aren’t testing enough people. So far the numbers released are saying that we have about 24 cases and a Wits student is quarantined, all this in 1 week it’s looking bad, in addition our economy is taking a hit because most people cannot work from home like I can. Thankfully I can still work and get paid but many people out there will start to strain without money. </p>
				<p>If this is just the calm before the storm as the officials are warning then I dread what is to come, many of our people have HIV as South Africa has one of the highest infection rates in the world. This means that our people are more likely to catch the virus and if they do are more likely to get sick and spread it further. This issue is amplified when you consider the virus just hit the major townships which have poor sanitation and can’t implement self-quarantine measures effectively.</p>
				<p>They say they are boosting our testing and that it’s all going as planned and I hope that’s true, anyway that’s all for now. Stay Safe out there.</p>
