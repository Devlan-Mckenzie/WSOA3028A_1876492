		<h2>The Library of Babel</h2>
			<p>The Library of Babel is a short story, in this story the whole universe is made up of this single Library. The narrator goes on to say that the Library is “indefinite, perhaps infinite” he then goes on to the physical description of the Library. The Library is made up of identical hexagonal galleries of an endless number. The galleries have 4 walls with 5 bookshelves each while the height of the room is always the same and is the height of the average librarian. The galleries use the sides with no bookshelves to connect to each other in a horizontal fashion using small corridors and in a vertical fashion using ventilation shafts.</p>
			<p>The narrator goes on to describe and emphasize the endlessness of the Library and how some doubt it. The narrator goes on to say the “The Library is a sphere whose exact centre is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable” to further weight his point.  He then moves on to 2 axioms the first is that the Library has always existed and the second is that there are 25 symbols used in different combinations that make up all the books in the library. The people of the library have gone through many stages ranging from hope that these books will enable mankind and solve all its problems, to searching for specific books or the attempt at decoding other languages or books that seemingly don’t make sense.</p>
			<p>The next axiom was that the library was complete and contained all possible combinations of the 25 symbols.  This meant that the Library contained all books, at first there was joy and hope but once the people of the Library started to search for books on themselves, with the chance being zero, they began to destroy books and kill each other. They were crushed by the knowledge that somewhere in some hexagon there was precious book that were forever out of reach crushed the hope and turned it to despair and thus some took their own lives.</p>
			<p>In the narrators old age he admits to searching for the book that catalogues all books the catalogue of catalogues when he was younger and even now hopes that someone will find the Book-Man. The Book-Man is a librarian who has read the catalogue of catalogues. The narrator comes to the conclusion that all books in the library have meaning even those that the reader doesn’t understand due to the language they are written in or the content of the book. He then concludes that the Library may be infinite but the number of books is not, which means that the library is bound to repeat itself at some point and thus he comes to the conclusion that “the Library is unlimited but periodic”.</p>
			<p>The Library of Babel was written before the internet was around and thus it is astounding that this writer had foreshadowed the creation of the internet. The Library is comparable to the internet in many ways and you have access to that library however you have the ability to search for books and they will be brought to you.  I hope you have a new found appreciation of the internet and enjoy it while you can.</p>
