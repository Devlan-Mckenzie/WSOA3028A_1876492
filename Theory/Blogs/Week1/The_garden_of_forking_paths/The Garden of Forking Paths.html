		<h2>The Garden of Forking Paths<h2>
			<p>The Garden of Forking Paths is a short story that is 5 pages in length.  The story begins by informing us that the following will shed light on why the British attack on the Serre-Montauban was delayed. The narrator goes on to say that the following is a statement given by DR. Yu Tsun. The first 2 pages of the statement are missing and so the statement begins abruptly. </p>
			<p>Yu Tsun was a German spy whose cover was just blown, his co-conspirator, Viktor Runeberg, was murdered or arrested by a man called Captain Richard Madden, and this is the man Yu Tsun must now escape from. Captain Richard Madden was an Irishman at the service of England and seemed to be unaware that Yu Tsun had the exact name of the location of the new British artillery park on the River Ancre.  It was Yu Tsun`s mission to deliver this name to the German Chief. He checked his pockets and found a number of things the important ones being a revolver with a single bullet and a letter. Tsun then checks the phone book and locates the address of the one person that can help him complete his mission. In order to meet this man Tsun had to take a train to the town of Ashgrove.  Tsun took a cab as he felt he was being watched and was vulnerable in the open and empty streets.</p>
			<p>Captain Richard Madden nearly caught Tsun at the train station, thankfully he misses the train. This filled Tsun with a sense of hope and confidence that he could complete his mission. At the Ashgrove station Tsun got off and was helped by some boys who directed him to the home of DR. Stephen Albert. Tsun tossed them a coin and followed their directions which happened to be the procedure for discovering the central point of a labyrinth. Tsun followed a road that forked continually and thought of labyrinths and his ancestor Ts`ui Pen who dedicated 12 years to the creation of a book that was murdered. The book was incoherent and no one found the labyrinth.</p>
			<p>Eventually Tsun arrived at the house which had a poplar grove and a pavilion, the pavilion played Chinese music which is familiar for Tsun and went unperceived until he arrived.  He is greeted by a man called Stephen Albert in Chinese his own language and is invited to see “The Garden of Forking Paths”. Tsun identifies himself as an ancestor of the creator of the garden and is invited in again. Dr Stephen Albert then proceeds to tell him of his ancestor Ts`ui Pen; he describes him as a Governor and a learner of many things who retired to write a novel and create a labyrinth. Many believe that Ts`ui Pen failed in both as the book made no sense and the labyrinth was never found.</p>
			<p> Stephen Albert, then explains that he studied the book and discovered that the book and ‘’The Garden of Forking Paths” are one and the same. Stephen then shows Tsun a letter which held the key to understanding his work, the sentence “I leave to the various futures (not to all) my garden of forking paths” this sentence as Stephen explains suggests a split in time and not in space.  In other words, whenever the characters in the book had to make a decision which would have more than one outcome all the outcomes would occur. This caused the narrative to branch out into multiple narratives each in their own universe separate from the other.  These universes then created more divided and thus went on to become infinite.</p>
			<p>The garden of forking paths was an incomplete collection of how Ts`ui Pen perceived the universe which had an infinite series of times which branched and forked off from one another and show all possibilities of time. At this point Tsun sees Captain Richard Madden approaching and asks to see the letter again. Tsun made sure to load the gun and proceeded to carefully shoot Stephen in the back, he swears the death was instant and painless.</p>
			<p>Madden arrested Tsun and he was condemned to the gallows however Tsun had completed his mission and indicated the city called Albert through the only means he could find in his given situation. The Garden of Forking Paths is similar to the Library of Babel in the description of the universe being infinite and in the way that a person cannot attain it all no matter how hard they try as it is simply impossibility. The forking in time goes on to show how each and every action is important and can have unforeseen consequences.</p>
