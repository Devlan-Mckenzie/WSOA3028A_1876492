			<h2><left>What is Hypertext</left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>19/02/2020</left></small></h4>
				<p>Over the years the term hypertext has gained popularity alongside the ever-growing internet and as a result the question has been raised many times. The answers are often from a wide range and sometimes mismatched.</p>
				<p>According to a paper written by Noah Wardrip-Fruin titled 'What Hypertext is' it was concluded that the term originally was a blanket term for forms of hypermedia. This definition contrasts the literacy definitions which focus solely on the link and it also contrasts the research community that placed knowledge work over that of media.</p>
				<p>In the paper it is shown that the definition alters from community to community and is highly influenced by the depth in which the community interacts with the term hypertext , often the focus stayed on the link and thus made an association between the term hypertext and hyperlink. The paper goes on to discuss how over time as the media in the world evolved as did the definition for hypertext; the creation of hyper film and hypermedia altered the definition to that of 'a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.'
The paper goes on to show how the term changed yet again to allow for new developments in the web to fit nicely in the term.</p>
				<p>In conclusion the paper ends off by saying those who which to discuss hypertext must make a simple choice about whether they want to acknowledge the history behind the word and thus adapt their current understanding to match that of the words history or not. 
The paper mentioned above is titled 'Wardrip-Fruin What Hypertext is-2004' and is well worth the read.</p>
