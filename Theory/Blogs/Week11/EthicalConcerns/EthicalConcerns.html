			<h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
				<p>This blog post will be discussing the issue raised when Joe Redmon, a man that created YOLO algorithms which shaped the path of modern object detection, stopped doing work on computer vision due to ethical concerns.</p>
				<p>This can be shown in twitter where Joe Redmon can be quoted saying “I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore.” This was a huge thing and went on to discuss how science is sometimes political and research isn’t always moral.</p>
				<p>These leads into the topic of discussion which is ethical concerns, which we can apply to our course and the theoretical work we have done here.  I believe that in the implementation of the web sites no ethics were intended to be harmed and that the readings supplied aided in the correct methods of content creation and helped us understand the ways in which we may transgress these ethics.</p>
				<p>The readings done in this course can be seen whilst making the content for this course and impacted the way we understood what we were making and doing. It gave a sense of appreciation and understanding in a way that just reading never could. The readings in this course are hand chosen and carefully explained to make sure that the ethical concerns they raise are understood. In reflecting on these I believe that I have learnt things that I never would have come across before and they have aided me in the creation of this site.</p>
				<p>Some of the topics touched involved the understanding of one’s decisions and how they may alter the path that you take, this can be seen in the Garden of Forking Paths which I have created a blog post on.  This topic made it apparent that the content I was putting up on my site will impact not only me but those around me as well. This also altered my behaviour about the course and the content within it. The way I acted with friends in the course as well as how I approached the course.</p>
				<p>I believe that my site does not infringe on any ethical issues and will take action to fix any issues that may arise.</p>
