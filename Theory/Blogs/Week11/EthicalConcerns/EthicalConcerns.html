			<h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
				<p>This blog post will be about ethics and concerns around them. This particular issue was recently brought to light when Joe Redmon, a man that created YOLO algorithms which shaped the path of modern object detection, stopped doing work on computer vision due to ethical concerns that he had.</p>
				<p>This can be verified by going to twitter where Joe can be quoted saying or tweeting “I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore.” These concerns he brought up and this event blew up and quickly gained everyone’s attention, major discussions were held around these topics. The most intriguing topic of discussion seemed to be that science is sometimes political and research isn’t always moral. This was alarming as science and research were often seen as pure and noble fields, even these fields were tainted by politics and power struggles. </p>
				<p>This leads us into the main point of this blog which is ethical concerns. These concerns can be applied to the course we are currently taking and all the work we have done while taking it. I believe that during the creation of this site no ethics were harmed and certainly none were intended to be harmed.  The readings supplied and recommended aided in creating content the right way and certainly helped us understand ways in which we might transgress these ethics.</p>
				<p>The readings mentioned above can be seen throughout this course and are referenced constantly, they aid and impacted the way we understand the content we are creating and what we are doing. The creation of this site gave a sense of appreciation and understanding in a way that simply reading never could. The readings in this course are hand chosen and are carefully explained to ensure that the ethical concerns they raise are understood. Upon reflecting on these I believe that I personally have learnt things that I never would have come across before and they have aided me in the creation of this site.</p>
				<p>We touched on many topics which emphasized the impact of one`s decision and understanding that impact. The concept was explored and showed how the decisions we make may alter the path you take in life and affect other people’s paths as well. This was seen heavily in the Garden of Forking Paths, which I have a blog post on if you are unfamiliar with it I encourage you to take a look or research it on your own. This topic made it apparent that any content I was putting on my site will impact not only me but those around me as well. This gradually altered my behaviour during the period of this course and the content produced and consumed within it. The way I acted with friends was affected in the course and altered the way I approached the course.</p>
				<p>I believe that my site does not infringe on any ethical issues, however I am still relatively new to site creation and may make a mistake at some point. Should anyone find an ethical concern please inform me through contact pages so that I may fix any issues that may arise. </p>
				<p>Until the next post stay safe out there.</p>
