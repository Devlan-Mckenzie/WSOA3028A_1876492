		<h2>Ways of Teaching and Learning Online</h2>
			<h3>Nominal Method of Teaching at Wits University</h3>
				<p>The normal and effect way of teaching at the University is in person at lectures where you can get live feedback and ask questions immediately, in addition to this there are libraries and internet access all over the campus.</p>
				<p>Some courses rely on labs to function and will in particular struggle with coping should the University get shutdown.</p>
				<p>In addition to this students living on campus at Residence will most likely struggle the most should the University shutdown as they may no longer have access to the internet.</p>
			<h3>In the Past</h3>
				<p>The University coped with the Fees must Fall Movement by shutting down the campus and making content available online and ISP`s helped with this by zero rating some websites such as Saikai, the official communication medium of WITS.</p>
			<h3>In the Future</h3>
				<p>The University will most likely shutdown as the sheer number of students in such a small area will create a hot spot for COVID 19 to grow. As such mostly likely the University will have to look to online mediums for help in running courses. In theory the ISP`s will zero rate the sites again and thus the use of Saikai as the main site for communication and teaching should be considered.</p>
				<p>Should this be the case then the Courses can make use of recorded videos to teach course content. This is an effective method of teaching however you lose the live interaction that is sometimes essential.</p>
				<p>Should this be the case then the use of a live conference and video sharing software should be considered such as Zoom, Google Hangouts and Skype. The problem here arises when one considers data usage as some students might not be able to access these services or should a student miss one due to load shedding or another issue.</p>
				<p>Thus it is probably a good idea to make use of both methods have live lectures and downloadable content so that no student is left in the dark and Saikai has a messaging platform so students can ask their questions there if needed.</p>
			<h3>Our Course in Particular</h3>
				<p>All the students in our course should have access to a laptop and most of the students have access to the internet or could get access in some way. The above might not work for course that require the use of a lab or specialised equipment but I believe that it might work for our courses and be successful to a large degree.</p>
