			<h2>The History of Flash</h2>
				<p>The Flash were are talking about here is some guy that runs really fast it’s the Adobe Flash extension and software used for many years during the internet’s development. For the most part the development of Flash runs parallel to the development of the web. Flash wasn’t always called Flash and was started in 1993 in a company called FutureWave Software.</p>
				<p>This company made a piece of software called SmartSketch for pen computing and during its testing phase many of the users noted how useful it could be for animation. This lead to the addition of basic animation capabilities before the software was released.  The development took too long and the pen computing trend had already come to an end, because of this the company decided to pull the animation out of SmartSketch and used it to create web based animation software called FutureSplash. This was released at the end of 1995, and was comprised of 2 products, FutureSplash Animator and FutureSplash Viewer, these allowed the users to create animation in the Animator and view them in the Viewer. This worked well for the most part but for users to actually view the animations they would have to download the viewer on their side of the browser. FutureWave was lucky in the sense that there was no competition in this area and thus was added to the Netscape featured extensions list and in 1996 was approached by Microsoft to create an embedded player for MSN.com which was the default home page of Internet Explorer. </p>
				<p>At the end of 1996 due to all this exposure the company called Macromedia bought FutureSplash and renamed it to Flash. Over the next few years Macromedia developed Flash had made some key features along the way.  The most crucial one being the addition of ActionScript in the year 2000, this feature allowed users to create entire interactive websites using the button functions and ActionScript. This lead to the creation of a whole new web design and in a way pushed the boundaries of what was possible on the web. People began to create content and even made Flash games that you could play online.</p>
				<p>The next major feature added was in 2002 when Flash version 6 was released, this version added full video support to the software what this meant was that one could have a reliable cross platform video player by simply embedding your videos in the flash animations and it would work.  The next major even happened in 2005 when 3 software engineers walked away from PayPal and created YouTube and they used flash to do so.</p>
				<p>Google later bought YouTube and at the end of 2006 Flash was so successful that most browsers came with Flash bundles as part of the download and thus recommend that you install it. All good things come to an end however and this happened in the year 2007 with the release of the iPhone. The iPhone did not come with Flash and this was foreshadowing the downfall of Flash. The reasons were outlined by Steve Jobs justified this in 2010 and basically said that it was for the promotion and openness of the web.</p>
				<p>In July of 2017, Adobe announced that they would officially be ending the support of Flash in the year 2020, this year, and soon after many browsers followed suit. This year means the end of Flash as we know it and many of you have already seen the effect of this and are keen to see where the web will take us.</p>
