			<h2>The Web 2.0</h2>
				<p>The term Web 2.0 refers to the period of time after 2004 and up until the creation of the Web 3.0 and its common use.  The term first surfaced in an article from the year 1999 written by Darcy DiNucci titled Fragmented Future. In this article she comments on how the static pages of Web 1.0 are only the embryo of the web to come and how the first hint of Web 2.0 were already appearing.  Darcy then makes an assumption that the internet will be able to show content dynamically and will connect too many things like TVs, cell phones, cars and even hand-held game machines. While this was a bit of a shot in the dark Darcy was right on the money and if you look at the concept The Internet of Things, it becomes hard to say she could ever be wrong. This goes to show how the hopes of the past have shaped the present and how even our hopes will shape the future.</p>
				<p>The term went silent for the next 3 years until it resurfaces in 2002 and became popular due to the first Web 2.0 conference where it was discussed at length. What was interesting to note was the concept that one could harness the user generated content and get value out of it. This was so accurate if one thinks of YouTube or Twitch or Facebook or any other similar platform.  In addition to these examples one must also think of text based examples such as Wikipedia whose content is updated and maintained by the users, this was a bit risky however the argument was given enough users all the bugs and errors will be seen and fixed, and to a very large extent this system has worked and worked well.</p>
				<p>The Web 2.0 had some new features that include the following Folksonomy, Rich User Experience, User Participation, Software as a Service (SaaS) and Mass Participation. These basically allowed users to tag and view content dynamically, this could be done by many users in addition users could now generate content and form communities online.  This also allowed SaaS to update software through the web and create apps that people could use this really allowed people to engage with the web browser and started to create a trend of content consumption.</p>
				<p>While this was a brief look into Web 2.0 I believe it highlights the just of it and allows you to understand the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. We are in a day and age when Web 3.0 is being talked about and it is believed that it will be able to understand you personally as a human and get to know you. This Web 3.0 will be intelligent and interact with you at a more humanoid level.</p>
