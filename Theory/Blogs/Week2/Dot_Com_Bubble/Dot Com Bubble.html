		<h2>The Dot Com Bubble</h2>
			<p>The Dot-Com Bubble was a stock market bubble in the late 1990s. This bubble came about due to massive growth of internet related companies due to conjecture of profits around them.  As a result many people wanted to become investors.  These people were soon convinced that they would make a profit that they would invest in any website that had “.com” or any internet related names in the URL.  The banks made a huge profit on the initial public offerings or IPOs. This reason is why the banks would encourage you to invest in this technology.</p>
			<p>People were willing to overlook traditional means of judging an investment like profit earnings ratios and began to place blind faith in these companies and believed they would make a profit.  This believe fuelled a massive increase in stock prices as there was a lot of competition to get the stock of these businesses with the hopes of becoming rich. The record for price earnings ratios was 80 before this event and after the event a company called Nasdaq Composite had its stock market index rise 400% and achieved a price earnings ratio of 200. This shattered the previous record set during the Japanese asset bubble in the year 1991.  This kind of behaviour was somewhat normal and many other types of stock rose exponentially during this period of time.</p>
			<p>This was fuelled by the populace that shattered the record for personal investment and stories of people quitting their jobs to engage in full-time day trading was common.  This behaviour was worsened by the news media that started to encourage and promote the idea of investment.  This investing habit became so drastic that a company that had never made a profit could make the creator an instant millionaire and if they were smart like Mark Cuban they reinvested into stable companies and entered hedges to protect their money from the coming bursting of the bubble.</p>
