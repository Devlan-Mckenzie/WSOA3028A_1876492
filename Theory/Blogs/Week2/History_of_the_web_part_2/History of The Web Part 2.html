			<h2>The History of the Web Part 2</h2>
				<p>In a previous part of this blog post called A Brief History of the World Wide Web Part 1 we covered the origin and development of the idea and implementation of the internet up until the point where it was demonstrable. Today we pick up where we left off and continue our journey of understanding and begin in the year 1991.</p>
				<p>In this year the project was developed further and the Line mode Browser was released to a limited audience. There were a lot of presentations revolving around the group called CERN and the WWW was released on the central CERN machines. After this followed the development of online files which used FTP or File Transfer Protocol to work, after this a mailing system was implemented and the 1st year status report was created.</p>
				<p>The following year updates were made to the Line mode browser and released via anonymous FTP. After this came the release of new GUI browsers one of them become popular and was called Viola.The project grew as more and more people joined and towards the end of the year there were 26 servers on which tests were being done. This is a massive growth from the single server back in 1990 and shows how fast the project was gaining traction in the world.</p>
				<p>In 1993 many browsers became available however the 2 most important ones are Mosaic for X and CERN`s Mac browser. This is because Mosaic started to charge a licensing fee which caused many people to drop the program and swap to the WWW program instead.  CERN soon after declared that the WWW technology would be free for anyone to use. This was a power move as it further served to boost their user count and placed them in a favourable light.  The number of servers continues to grow and near the end of the year are around 200. These servers were HTTP servers and were being used around the regions of Europe. This lead to the first Web-based project WISE and was aimed at the dissemination of technological information to Europe`s less favoured regions.  This basically allowed the less fortunate to learn of these technological advancements and furthered the interest of its development. This set up the stage for what was to come in the following year.</p>
				<p>In the year 1994 the Internet in a box product was announced and allowed people to use the web from home.  The first international WWW Conference hosted by CERN otherwise called the Geneva conference occurred in this year. This was a major event in the history of the web and shaped how the web would develop in the future.  At this point in time there are about 1500 registered servers and the load on the first web server hosted by CERN was over 1000 times what it was just 3 years earlier.</p>
				<p>Towards the end of the year many groups have been formed and the first W3 Consortium meeting is held at M.I.T in Cambridge in the United States of America. CERN starts the construction of the Large Hadron Collider accelerator, this is basically CERN`s next machine and is meant to compete with the US Superconducting Supercollider.   As you can see CERN is continually at the forefront of the web`s development and attempts to remain in the front of the rapid growth of the web.</p>
				<p>The next year is 1995 and is the final year for this blog post, should you wish to read more on the web`s history please look for my blog post on the Browser Wars. In this year the G7 meeting is held mainly for Web discussion in the European Parliament buildings in Brussels. As the meeting was held in a Parliament building I can only assume that the web and the laws around it were discussed and these will have had a major impact on the years to come. In this year CERN also held a 2 day seminar to demonstrate the WWW to 250 reporters and allowed the reporters to interact with machine and the web. In essence CERN allowed these reporters to browse the web on 60 of their machines and had many scholars there to aid in this process.</p>
				<p>After this another WWW conference was held where the topic was Tools and Applications, this was hosted by Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.  The Web Society was formed shortly after. That’s all for this post I`m afraid, as mentioned before if you haven’t already go look up my blog post on Browser Wars for more information on the competition between browsers and the eventual winner.  As always I hope you found this as interesting and informative as I did.</p>
