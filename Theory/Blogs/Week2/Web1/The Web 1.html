		<h2>The Web 1.0</h2>
			<p>The term Web 1.0 is used to refer to the period of time where the World Wide Web was in the early stages of its creation. This time period was between 1991 and 2004, during this period many users were only consuming information and very little were producing new content unlike the internet we know of today. This was because in this period you would have to host your own website and pay an ISP to host it for you and free sites were you could post a comment or add a blog weren’t around as they are today.</p>
			<p>The main reason for this is that it was the Web 1.0 and as such its defining characteristics wouldn’t allow for this.  This meant that the pages were static and couldn’t be interacted with in a way that would add new content like adding comments or posting blogs. The way the sites were run meant the content was being provided by a server`s filesystem instead of a relational database management system. This meant that the managing of the data was manual and that if you wanted to display new content you would have to add it and format it manually. The ability to have a website adapt and become dynamic was through HTML and Scripting. These however were still new concepts and were in the process of being developed. Some of the more useful tags of HTML only got created during the Browser Wars.</p>
			<p>In this time the only real feedback method was interacting with a form that when completed would send an email. In addition to this the website itself isn’t interactive and users would have to use “mailto” forms to send feedback as mentioned above.</p>
			<p>As always I hope you enjoyed this blog post and if you haven’t already please look up my other posts and give them a read. I find it simply amazing that you guys will be reading this through a system that is far superior to that of the past and many of you will not even realise it. I hope this was informative and helps put things in perspective.</p>
