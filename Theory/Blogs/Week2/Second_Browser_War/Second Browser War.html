					<h3>Second War</h3>
						<p>The second war was made possible because Netscape open-sourced their browser code once they started to lose the first war. They later then entrusted it to Mozilla which was a non-profit newly formed foundation.</p>
						<p>This eventually lead to the release of Mozilla's Firefox 1.0 which was released on the 9 of November in 2004. This became the Mozilla Foundations primary focus and lead to them gaining increases in browser market shares until they peaked in 2010.</p>
						<p>In 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service pack 1 would be the last standalone version and that future enhancements would be reliant on Windows Vista. This clearly contrasts the efforts of its competitors, which joined efforts with the intent of developing more capable and backward-compatible technologies. The collaboration resulted in the creation of WHATWG.</p>
						<p>The growth in device combinations in use changed the course of the war yet again. This caused the shift in focus to market your browser based on how closely it adhered to the legally mandated web accessibility.</p>
						<p>This is just the start of the second war and this rise and fall of browsers continued with the eventual result being today's browsers. Google Chrome had won the war and by 2019 had crossed the 70% share of web usage on personal computers and maintained over 60% combining all devices.</p>
