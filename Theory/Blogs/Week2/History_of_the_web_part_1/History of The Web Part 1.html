		<h2>The History of the Web Part 1</h2>
			<p>It all started back in the year 1945 when a man name Vannevar Bush wrote an article in the Atlantic Monthly which described a memory extension device or Memex as he called it. The Memex was supposedly a photo-electrical-mechanical device. The purpose of a Memex was to store all your books, records and communications which could be accessed with speed.</p>
			<p>This was followed by a 15 year silence in regards to the World Wide Web, this goes to show how far ahead of his time Vannevar Bush was. This gap places us in the 1960s this is when, Doug Engelbart created an online system called the NLS which could be used for hypertext browsing, editing and email. Doug also invented the mouse for the sole purpose of engaging with his creation.  After this in 1965 Ted Nelson coined the word Hypertext in his paper A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate. The Hypertext Editing System and FRESS were built by Andy van Dam among others in the year 1967.</p>
			<p>This was followed by a 13 year silence. This silence was broken in the year 1980 by a man called Tim Berners-Lee who wrote a notebook program called Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything which allowed links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each one of these nodes had a title, a type and a list of bidirectional typed links.  This was important as it began linking nodes of the internet by more than just webpage titles and had a significant impact at CERN. In 1989 Tim wrote another paper called Information Management: A Proposal, this paper was circulated around CERN and comments were taken. This lead to the creation of a universal linked information system which would be generalised and portable so that the information contained could grow past a threshold.  CERN would then link large databases together and allow the growth to continue. This already begins to sound like the birth of the internet that we know and love for its ability to be used by all and expand easily.</p>
			<p>In the 1990s the same paper by Tim was circulated again this results in Tim`s boss purchasing a NeXT cube and allows Tim to begin writing a global hypertext system. Soon after this Tim starts to work on the GUI browser and editor using the NeXTStep development environment. Tim then made up the “WorldWideWeb” as a name for the program. After this the project got the attention of CN and ECP divisional management and Robert Cailliau from ECP joins the project and becomes a co-author of the new version.  They then made the first ever web page and Nicola Pellow and Bernd Pollermann from CN joined the project and started to work on the line-mode browser and interface running. TBL contributed to hypertext in general.</p>
			<p>In the year 1990 during Christmas the Line mode browser and WorldWideWeb browser were demonstrable, people could access hypertext files and internet news article.</p>
			<p>This was just a brief look into the WorldWideWeb and is only part 1 of my intended blogposts. I just think it’s amazing to see how something we take for granted was created so long ago and how fast it was developed into what it is today. The way a handful of people from the past shaped the world today to this extent is simply breath-taking. The works of Vannevar Bush, Borges and Tim Berners-Lee were before their time and they spoke of the internet in such awe. Their works which described the internet as a safe all is something we have and take for granted. I hope with these posts to humble at least a few of the readers and help them find a new sense of gratitude.</p>
