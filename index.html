			<h2><left>The Importance of Semantic Mark Up </left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>23/02/2020</left></small></h4>
					<p>The first time I interacted or even learnt about the power of semantic mark up was in a web design course back when I was still studying at Wits University. The lecturer spoke of how many people use the term Semantic Mark up but very few people truly understand the importance or meaning behind it. These words stuck with me, he went on to describe how Semantics referred to the correct interpretation or use of a word while markup was a language type. This lead on to HTML which stands for Hyper Text Mark up Language which the lecturer then used to describe semantics and went on to show us the true meaning behind his words.</p>
					<p>As a Web Developer it is important to understand that you are designing for everyone even those that cannot see. Thus, just because your website looks good does not mean that it is good and a way to truly check if a website is good is to see if they made the site using the correct Semantics in the HTML code.  The way the lecturer passed on his key point was by saying that if someone was blind, they would use a device to read the site to them. The device could only operate using HTML code and interpret the code in a Semantic way. The lecturer then went on to show us how many ways you can achieve the same result, some with semantics and some without semantics. The truly astounding part was that these sites looked the same however if you used one of these devices the sites would not even resemble each other.  The reason was Semantics, the point was to make you aware of this fact and to get you to use the correct tags when creating a site.  This way the device could interpret your site correctly, next he went on to describe how google uses bots like these devices to trawl the internet and based on how well you used semantics would give your site a rating. This rating would then affect if your site would pop up in searches as google now knew what was on your site and could search for it appropriately.</p>
					<p>This was a really powerful tool now , if u make the site with the correct semantics then google will give your site priority over less semantic sites simply because it can interpret it better than others. In this way you can create better sites than before simply by using the correct Semantic Mark Up language and sacrifice nothing in terms of appearance as often these sites look identical to one another. Stay away from the div tag as it has no semantic meaning rather use article or the section tags to layout your website. 
In conclusion Semantic Mark up is rather simple to use, just use the tags for their intended purpose and then google bots and other devices will be able to correctly interpret your site.

			<h2><left>An Easy Way to Stay Up to Date and Integrate Code </left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>23/02/2020</left></small></h4>
					<p>One of the first things they teach you in some coding courses at Wits University is the importance of having backups and working well with in a work or group environment. The easiest and most affordable way of doing this is to use Git. The main value in Git is that it is very easy to use and has many tutorials and large amounts of content to help you learn their program and that it is free. It is a great way to keep your code up to date and to keep it safe; Git acts as an online repository that you can commit changes to and create many sub repositories to test code out without having to create entire backups on your machine.</p>
					<p>Git is a practical way of working with in a team or organization as you can all work on the same project at the same time and see any changes done as well as any errors or clashes in code and simply resolve them. The processes of doing this is as simple as click a button and view what appears on screen.  Git has a website which you can login to and view any changes any where around the world and Git also has a desktop application which you can install and use as part of your pipeline when creating code.  This makes Git easy to use and allows you to make changes and store them on your machine even when u do not have access to the internet , and when you do get access to the internet you can simply commit them to the web.</p>
					<p>In short if you are struggling to keep up to date within a team or even on your own , use Git to store all you changes and history in one place, I would strongly recommend that you install their desktop application and make it part of your pipeline. If you get lost be sure to use their free help and tutorials online and best of all its free so be sure to give it a try.</p>

			<h2><left>Research on Browser Wars </left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>19/02/2020</left></small></h4>
					<p>A Browser War is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. There were 2 main browser wars they were between the years of 1995 and 2017, which means that they occurred fairly recently with the last war ending only 3 years ago</p>
					<h3>First War</h3>
					<p>The First Browser War began in the late 1990's with the main competitors being Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape`s Navigator. The first war lasted until 2002 with the eventual winner being Internet Explorer, which went on to become the new dominant browser with a 96% peak in web browser usage shares.  This outcome brought an end to innovative web browsers until the release if Mozilla Firefox 1.0 in 2004.</p>
					<p>By 1995 the world wide web has received a lot of attention and become popular in culture and mass media, at the time Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and to compete with them Microsoft licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0 which they then distributed for free as part of the Windows 95 Plus pack.  Internet Explorer 2.0 was released for free within 3 months of the initial release. The idea of releasing your web browser for free caught on and soon many larger companies were following suit. Netscape Navigator followed suit and bundled their browser with other applications.</p>
					<p>After this many rapid updates introduced new features such as Netscape's JavaScript which Microsoft replicated and called Jscript as well as HTML tags like Blink.</p>
					<p>At this point it might be sounding like Netscape is in dire time, however , Netscape still had 72% of the web browser usage and it wasn't until Internet Explorer 4.0 was released that they took a major blow.
Internet Explorer 4 was what changed the tides of the war as it was integrated into Microsoft Windows which gave it a much larger installation base. The larger pool of money allowed Microsoft to release their browser for free and to use the larger pool of money to further development and advertisement.</p>
					<p>In the end Netscape was acquired by America Online for US$ 4.2 Billion. This final defeat allowed Internet Explorer to become the dominant web browser until the second web browser war.</p>

					<p>The image above shows Internet Explorer in blue, Netscape in green and Mozilla Firefox in red with yellow being other.</p>
					<h3>Second War</h3>
					<p>The second war was made possible because Netscape open-sourced their browser code once they started to lose the first war. They later then entrusted it to Mozilla which was a non-profit newly formed foundation.</p>
					<p>This eventually lead to the release of Mozilla's Firefox 1.0 which was released on the 9 of November in 2004. This became the Mozilla Foundations primary focus and lead to them gaining increases in browser market shares until they peaked in 2010.</p>
					<p>In 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service pack 1 would be the last standalone version and that future enhancements would be reliant on Windows Vista. This clearly contrasts the efforts of its competitors, which joined efforts with the intent of developing more capable and backward-compatible technologies. The collaboration resulted in the creation of WHATWG.</p>
					<p>The growth in device combinations in use changed the course of the war yet again. This caused the shift in focus to market your browser based on how closely it adhered to the legally mandated web accessibility.</p>
					<p>This is just the start of the second war and this rise and fall of browsers continued with the eventual result being today's browsers. Google Chrome had won the war and by 2019 had crossed the 70% share of web usage on personal computers and maintained over 60% combining all devices.</p>
