		<h2>Greetings and Welcome to my Site</h2>
			<p>
				<center>	
					Thanks for being here, please feel free to look around. You will find a lot of content about the history of the internet and some of the important events around it here. My name is Stephen Burns and this is my first website, the aim of this site is help educate people who have an interest in the internet just like me.
					<br>
						Please keep in mind that I am still learning and have a long way to go before I can safely say I can make a good website. If this concerns you don`t worry we can learn together through my weekly blog posts.
