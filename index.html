			<h2><left>The Importance of Semantic Mark Up </left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>23/02/2020</left></small></h4>
					<p>The first time I interacted or even learnt about the power of semantic mark up was in a web design course back when I was still studying at Wits University. The lecturer spoke of how many people use the term Semantic Mark up but very few people truly understand the importance or meaning behind it. These words stuck with me, he went on to describe how Semantics referred to the correct interpretation or use of a word while markup was a language type. This lead on to HTML which stands for Hyper Text Mark up Language which the lecturer then used to describe semantics and went on to show us the true meaning behind his words.</p>
					<p>As a Web Developer it is important to understand that you are designing for everyone even those that cannot see. Thus, just because your website looks good does not mean that it is good and a way to truly check if a website is good is to see if they made the site using the correct Semantics in the HTML code.  The way the lecturer passed on his key point was by saying that if someone was blind, they would use a device to read the site to them. The device could only operate using HTML code and interpret the code in a Semantic way. The lecturer then went on to show us how many ways you can achieve the same result, some with semantics and some without semantics. The truly astounding part was that these sites looked the same however if you used one of these devices the sites would not even resemble each other.  The reason was Semantics, the point was to make you aware of this fact and to get you to use the correct tags when creating a site.  This way the device could interpret your site correctly, next he went on to describe how google uses bots like these devices to trawl the internet and based on how well you used semantics would give your site a rating. This rating would then affect if your site would pop up in searches as google now knew what was on your site and could search for it appropriately.</p>
					<p>This was a really powerful tool now , if u make the site with the correct semantics then google will give your site priority over less semantic sites simply because it can interpret it better than others. In this way you can create better sites than before simply by using the correct Semantic Mark Up language and sacrifice nothing in terms of appearance as often these sites look identical to one another. Stay away from the div tag as it has no semantic meaning rather use article or the section tags to layout your website. 
In conclusion Semantic Mark up is rather simple to use, just use the tags for their intended purpose and then google bots and other devices will be able to correctly interpret your site.

			<h2><left>An Easy Way to Stay Up to Date and Integrate Code </left></h2>
				<h4><small><left>23/02/2020</left></small></h4>
					<p>One of the first things they teach you in some coding courses at Wits University is the importance of having backups and working well with in a work or group environment. The easiest and most affordable way of doing this is to use Git. The main value in Git is that it is very easy to use and has many tutorials and large amounts of content to help you learn their program and that it is free. It is a great way to keep your code up to date and to keep it safe; Git acts as an online repository that you can commit changes to and create many sub repositories to test code out without having to create entire backups on your machine.</p>
					<p>Git is a practical way of working with in a team or organization as you can all work on the same project at the same time and see any changes done as well as any errors or clashes in code and simply resolve them. The processes of doing this is as simple as click a button and view what appears on screen.  Git has a website which you can login to and view any changes any where around the world and Git also has a desktop application which you can install and use as part of your pipeline when creating code.  This makes Git easy to use and allows you to make changes and store them on your machine even when u don’t have access to the internet , and when you do get access to the internet you can simply commit them to the web.</p>
					<p>In short if you are struggling to keep up to date within a team or even on your own , use Git to store all you changes and history in one place, I would strongly recommend that you install their desktop application and make it part of your pipeline. If you get lost be sure to use their free help and tutorials online and best of all its free so be sure to give it a try.</p>
